HOW TO INSTALL THIS:

  The same as usual; see 'perldoc perlmodinstall' if you're stuck.

TESTING NOTES:

  There are (small) mp3 files in t/ - I stole these from pudge's test
  directory in the MP3::Info module.  I hope I'm not going to get yelled
  at for that. I've not even actually listened to them. Yes, two of them
  are tagged like they're real proper good music. No, they're not really
  Kristin Hersh stuff. Go buy CDs.
